                        <p>I've always been one to ask why. Why does this work? How did they do that? How can one thing relate to another? Throughout my life, I've also found an interest in technology and I wanted to use my curiosity and passion to be able to affect the world by providing meaningful technology.</p> 
                        <p>Because of this as a child I was constantly learning new ideas and concepts, eventually, I wanted to apply some of the principles I've learned. I found Software the most accessible, opportune, and competitive space where I can continue to learn and apply some cool concepts, which can scale and affect a vast amount of people</p> 
                        <p>I hope to be in California bound where I can apply some of my skills in the tech hub of the world, and have a chance at contributing to the innovation and fast pace environment of leaders of the tech industry go through every day.</p>

                                    Ever wanted to talk with your friends and play a game at the same time. Well, you are in luck, I used socket.io and express in node.js to create a chat interface in which two users can communicate with each other while playing Google's famous Dinosaur Game to pass the time.

                                    During the transition from in-person to online school, I often found myself getting distracted by the news. I then decided to create a python program that takes a user's input of website domains, which access a computer's hosts file to redirect a user's search request, therefore blocking the website. I am currently learning to do this with a proxy server instead!

                                  This application allows a user to insert an encrypted file with a message in a GUI, which then spits out the true message! The file in this case SingleStream.txt can be modified after the program begins reading to act as if it were decrypting real-time messages, as it is impossible to send a message instantaneously.
